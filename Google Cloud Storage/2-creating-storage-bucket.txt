How to create a new storage bucket:
===================================
1. Use the `gsutil mb` command: 
	`gsutil mb gs://demo-bucket-shetu`
2. Optional flags to have greater control over the creation of our bucket:

-p: Specify the project with which our bucket will be associated.
	ex: `my-first-project`
-c: Specify the default storage class of our bucket.
	example: `NEARLINE`
-l: Specify the location of our bucket.
	example: `US-EAST1`
-b: Enable uniform bucket-level access.

Complete Example: 
-----------------
`gsutil mb -p my-first-project -c NEARLINE -l US-EAST1 -b on gs://demo-bucket-shetu`


Code Samples to create new bucket (python):
===========================================

# importing library
from google.cloud import storage

# function to create a bucket class location
def create_bucket_class_location(bucket_name):
	"""Create a new bucket in specific location with storage class"""
# bucket_name = "my-new-bucket-name"
	# creating storage client
	storage_client = storage.Client()
	
	# creating a bucket with bucket name
	bucket = storage_client.bucket(bucket_name)
	
	# creating bucket storage class name
	bucket.storage_class = "COLDLINE"
	
	# creating a new bucket object
	new_bucket = storage_client.create_bucket(bucket, location="us")
	
	# print the created bucket details
	print(
		"Created bucket {} in {} with storage class {}".format(new_bucket.name, new_bucket.location, new_bucket.storage_class)
	)
	
	# return the newly created bucket object
	return new_bucket
	
REST APIS:
==========
1. Get an authorization access token from the OAuth 2.0 Playground. Configure the playground to use your own OAuth credentials.
2. Create a .json file that contains the settings for the bucket, which must include a name for the bucket.

	JSON to create bucket:
	----------------------
		{
		 "name": "demo-bucket-shetu",
		 "location": "US-EAST1",
		 "storageClass": "NEARLINE",
		 "iamConfiguration": {
		 	"uniformBucketLevelAccess": {
		 		"enabled": true
		 	},
		 }
		}
	- This is the required @JSON_FILE
	
	cURL to call the JSON API:
	-------------------------
		curl -X POST --data-binary @JSON_FILE_NAME.json \
		-H "Authorization: Bearer OAUTH2_TOKEN" \
		-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
		"https://storage.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b?project=PROJECT_ID"
