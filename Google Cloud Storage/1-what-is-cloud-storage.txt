What is Cloud Storage:
---------------------- 
 i) Cloud Storage is a service for storing your objects in Google Cloud.
 ii) An object is an immutable piece of data consisting of a file of any format.
 iii) We store objects in containers called buckets.
 iv) All buckets are associated with a project and we can group our projects under an organization.
 
 Google Cloud hierarchy: 
 -----------------------
 	Organization -> Project -> Bucket -> Object

a) Organization: Our company called `Example Inc.` creates a Google Cloud organization called: `exampleinc.org`.

b) Project: `Example Inc.` is building several applications, and each one is assocaiated with a project. Each project has its own set of Cloud Storage APIs, as well as other resources.

c) Bucket: Each project can contain multiple buckets, which are conatainers to store your objects.
 
Example: 
For photos - Photos bucket
For videos - Videos bucket

d) Object: An individual file, such as an image called: puppy.png.

Basic tools for Cloud Storage:
------------------------------
i) Console : Visual interface
ii) gsutil : command line tool to allow us to interact through terminal
iii) Client libraries : Allow us to manage data using preferred languages.
iv) Rest APIs : Manages our data using the JSON or XML API.

Securing Data:
--------------
i) IAM (Identity and Access Management): We can grant members certain types of access to buckets and objects such as: update, create or delete

ii) Data encryption: Uses server side encryption to encrypt data by default. We can also use: customer-managed encryption keys, customer-supplied ecryption keys.

iii) Authentication: Ensures that anyone who accesses data has proper credentials.

iv) Bucket Lock: Govern how long objects in buckets must be retained by - specific retention policy.

v) Object Versioning: When a live version of an object is replaced or deleted, it can be retained as a noncurrent version if we enable: `Object Versioning`
